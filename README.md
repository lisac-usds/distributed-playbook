# distributed-playbook
COVID-19 is forcing many leaders and employees to make hard choices about remote work by necessity. We appreciate everyone who is confronting this new reality, making courageous decisions without the benefit of experience or practice. 

Truss began in 2012 as a distributed company, by three founders who led virtual, distributed teams since 2004. As a company, we've learned how to evolve and scale distributed practices to nearly 100 people in over 20 states and counting. Deciding to be a distributed company continues to be one of our best business decisions.

We’d like to share what we’ve learned about distributed work to help you make great decisions in this difficult time. We are mindful that this is a stressful time for all, and we offer this to help you navigate these tricky waters...and perhaps emerge a stronger, more resilient company.
